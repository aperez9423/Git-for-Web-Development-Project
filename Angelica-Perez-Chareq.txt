Stretch Questions

1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

   -The element is removed from the normal document flow when positioned absolutely. IT is placed relative to the closest positioned ancestor or relation to the initial containing block if no ancestor is present.
3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
   -You will need to use the property value inline-block so that it only takes up the space it needs and allows you to give it a width.
